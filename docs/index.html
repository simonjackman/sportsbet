<div id="summary" class="highlights">
<p>As of 10pm Wednesday 27 April, Sportsbet betting odds imply:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Labor to form the next government with
63.7% probability.</p></li>
<li><p>9 House of Representatives seats are priced as changing hands; see section <a href="#seats-changing-hands">3.3</a> below.</p></li>
<li><p>Independents favourites in 4 seats: Clark, Indi, Warringah, Wentworth.</p></li>
<li><p>Current Sportsbet prices are consistent with a 3.2 percentage point TCP swing from the Coalition to Labor; see <a href="#ipow-rship">3.4</a> below.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This analysis examines Sportsbet odds in various election betting markets for the
2022 Australian federal election.</p>
<p>We convert odds into <em>implied probabilities of winning</em> (IPOW) using a procedure
explained in the Appendix.</p>
<p>In the tables and charts below, we express IPOWs as percentages. Long shots (IPOWS &lt; 10%) are set to zero and the remaining IPOWs re-normalised to sum to 100%.</p>

<p>We compute expected seat counts by summing the seat-specific probabilities of
winning implied by Sportsbet’s odds as at 10pm Wednesday 27 April. In seats where Sportsbet is not currently offering prices we use the last observed odds in that seat.</p>
<p>The second column of seat counts removes “long-shots”; the third column counts seats where the indicated party has the highest
IPOW.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Appendix</h1>
<p>Australian bookmakers tend to use decimal odds, the return to the punter of a
successful unit or one-dollar wager. In general, the more likely the event, the
closer the decimals odds approach 1.00 from above; conversely, the less likely
the event, decimal odds take on increasingly larger values.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(d = (d_1, \ldots, d_J)&#39;\)</span> are decimal odds over <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> mutually exclusive and
exhaustive outcomes then the implied probability of event <span class="math inline">\(j \in 1, \ldots, J\)</span>
is conventionally recovered as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:normalisation">\[\begin{equation}
  p_j = \frac{1/d_j}{\sum_{k=1}^J 1/d_k}
  \tag{4.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In the context of elections, we refer to <span class="math inline">\(p_j\)</span> as the <em>implied probability of
winning</em> or IPOW for party or candidate <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>This transformation of decimal odds into IPOWs can be rationalised as follows.
Bookmakers set prices not merely as a function of their beliefs about outcomes,
but also to lock in profits. The most telling case comes from observing that for
coin tosses ahead of cricket matches, bookmakers typically offer prices of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> =
1.91 or thereabouts for each of the two outcomes; more surprising is that
gamblers participate in this market at all. This is a case where the <em>actual</em>
probabilities held by both bookmakers and punters can be reasonably presumed to
be .5 for each of the two outcomes. A fair price on a unit wager is therefore
2.00, with expected value of 1.00 = .5 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 2.00 + .5 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 0.</p>
<p>Observe that the fair price of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> = 2.00 is simply the inverse of the
probability of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = .5. This result generalises: fair decimal odds are simply
the inverse of the probabilities of the corresponding events, or <span class="math inline">\(d = 1/p\)</span> and
conversely <span class="math inline">\(p = 1/d\)</span>.</p>
<p>But bookmakers prices can not be assumed to be fair. For the coin toss example,
the bookmakers’ prices of <em>less</em> than the fair price of 2.00 reflect their
profit margin. With decimals odds of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> = 1.91, the bookmaker will lose 91
cents on each successful dollar wager, but keep $1.00 on each unsuccessful
wager. This asymmetry in payouts with respect to equally likely events is the
key to the adage that “the house always wins”. In this example the bookmaker has
an expected yield of 4.5c cents per dollar waged.</p>
<p>Alternatively, applying the rule that probabilities are the inverses of the
corresponding decimal odds, then with prices of 1.91 on both outcomes, the
bookmaker’s apparent probabilities are 0.5236 for each outcome. This clearly
violates the law of total probability (that the probabilities over the set of
possible outcomes sum to one), in this case summing to 1.0471.</p>
<p>The apparent “extra probability” is known as the “over-round” or “vigorish”.
Bookmakers prices therefore reflect at least two inputs: (1) probabilities about
events; (2) profit margins <span class="citation">(Cortis 2015)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(p_j\)</span> be
the bookmakers’ privately held probability of event <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. A profit-motivated
bookmaker offers prices of <span class="math inline">\(d_j = 1/\pi_j\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\pi_j = p_j(1+k_j)\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(k_j &gt; 0\)</span> the source of the bookmaker’s profits.</p>
<p>In the literature assessing the predictive value of betting markets, the
conversion from decimal odds almost always assumes <span class="math inline">\(k_j\)</span> is a constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> over
all events <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, giving rise to the transformation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{1/d_j}{\sum_j 1/d_j} = \frac{\pi_j}{\sum_j \pi_j} = \frac{p_j(1+k)}{\sum_j p_j(1+k)} = \frac{(1+k)\, p_j}{(1+k)\sum_j p_j} = p_j,
\]</span> as per equation <a href="#eq:normalisation">(4.1)</a>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Štrumbelj (2014)</span> and <span class="citation">Levitt (2004)</span>
survey cases where <span class="math inline">\(k_j\)</span> might reasonably be expected to <em>not</em> be constant over
outcomes <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>; examples include information and skill asymmetries between
bookmakers and punters and/or bookmakers seeking to counter insider-trading.
Betting markets with large numbers of gamblers and bookmakers should generally
drive these effects towards zero, resulting in small variability in <span class="math inline">\(k_j\)</span> over
alternatives, validating the mapping from odds to IPOWs in equation
<a href="#eq:normalisation">(4.1)</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, prior research suggests that seat-by-seat markets are thinly traded,
and so we interpret IPOWs in these markets with appropriate caveats.
Following my earlier work <span class="citation">(Jackman 2015)</span>, one of the goals of this
analysis in its post-election phase will be to assess the calibration of IPOWs
with election outcomes.</p>
